permalink: /s3/

## GENERAL FACTS
-	S3 has by default PRIVATE Buckets
-	Setup access control using: Bucket Policies and ACLs
-	Can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket
-	Versioning, once enabled, cannot be disabled, only suspended
-	S3 Bucket Properties
- Server Access Logging
  - Provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket
- Object Access Logging
-	ARCHIVAL RETRIEVAL OPTIONS
  - Expedited – 1-5 minutes
  - Standard – 3-5 hours
  - Bulk 5-12 hours

## S3 FEATURES
-	Tiered storage available
-	Lifecycle Management Policies
-	Versioning
-	Encryption
-	MFA Delete
-	Secure with Bucket Policies and ACL

## DATA STORAGE
-	The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. 
-	Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. 
-	The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. 
-	For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability.


## PERFORMANCE
To Increase performance, all object names should be prefixed with a hex hash key along with the current date

## STORAGE CLASSES

### S3 Standard
-	99.99% Availability
-	99.9999999999% durability
-	stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities
-	designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently

### S3 – IA (Infrequently Accessed)
-	For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed
-	Lower fee that S3, but charged a retrieval fee

### S3 One Zone – IA
-	For where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require multiple AZ data resilience

### S3 – Intelligent Tiering
-	Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most effective access tier, without performance impact or opetational overhead

### S3 – Glacier
-	Glacier is a secure, durable and low-cost storage class for data archiving
-	Retrieval time configurable from minutes to hours

### S3 Glacier Deep Archive
-	Amazon S3’s lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable

## DATA CONSISTENCY

-	Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
-	Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
-	A successful response to a PUT of a new object only occurs when the object is completely saved

## ENCRYPTION

Encryption in Transit is achieved by:
-	SSL/TLS
Encryption at Rest (Server Side) is achieved by:
-	S3 Managed Keys – SSE-S3
  - Each object is encrypted with a unique key employing strong multi-factor encryption.
  - As an additional safeguard, it encypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates
-	AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys – SSE-KMS
  - Similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits and additional charges for using this service
  - There are separate permissions for the use of an envelope key (key that protects your encryption key) that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in S3
-	Server-Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys – SSE-C
- Client manages the encryption keys
  - Amazon S3 manages the encryption (writes to disks) and decryption (when you access your objects)


## LIFECYCLE POLICIES

-	Automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers
-	Can be used in conjucation with versioning
-	Can be applied to current version and previous versions


## CROSS REGION REPLICATION

-	Versioning must be enabled on both the source and the destination buckets
-	Regions must be unique
-	Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
-	All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically
-	Delete markers are not replicated
-	Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated

## Static Websites on S3

You can host a static website on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET. Amazon S3 does not support server-side scripting. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has resources for hosting dynamic websites


## S3 TRANSFER ACCELARATION
-	Enables fast, easy and secure transfer of files over long distances between your end users and a S3 bucket
-	Takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront globally distributed edge locations
-	As the data arrives, at an Edge Location, Data is routed to AWS S3 over an optimized work path
-	NOT ENABLED BY DEFAULT
